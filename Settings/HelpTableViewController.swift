Write the firstname, followed by a space, followed by the lastname, followed by a comma and another space. Clicking on a guest cell when at the guests list will open a view of that guest.

When a table is added, long press on that table until it turns semi-transparent to move it around the floor plan. To delete, turn, or edit a table, simply tap on it. This tap will bring up a pop-up menu with three buttons. The first button will remove the table from the floor plan, the second will turn the table 90 degrees, and the last button will open up a table view of the tapped table. To increase your floor plan's size and make it scrollable, drag and drop a table to either the right or bottom of the screen.

    + "- A guest's must-sit-at-table-of constraint has more guests than the size of the average table. For example, if there are 12 people in a tabling constraint and all the tables in the current plan only have 10 seats, the constraint can't be fulfilled. \n"
    + "- There is overlapping between guests' constraints that ultimately make them all impossible to satisfy. For example, while there may be an empty table with 12 seats to accomodate a 12 person tabling constraint, other guests outside of that constraint might have a must-sit-at-table constraint for that same 12 person table. This means 13 or more guests must sit there but that is not possible. \n"
    + "- A constraint may seem to be fine, but can be conflicting with already seated guests. Previously seated guests cannot be moved by the sorting feature in order to not tamper with seating choices already made by the user."
